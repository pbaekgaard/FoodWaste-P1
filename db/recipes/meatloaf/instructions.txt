    STEP 1
    Put all the ingredients for the mince - with the exception of olives and feta - in a large bowl and whisk it together with a hand mixer for 1-2 minutes.
    Finally, turn the crumbled feta and half the olives in.

    STEP 2
    Grease an ovenproof dish with butter.
    Shape the mince into an oblong mince loaf and place it in the center of the dish.
    Turn the potatoes with oil and salt and spread them on each side.
    Feel free to use the potatoes to hold a little together on the father's bread.

    STEP 3
    Bake the puff pastry in a preheated oven at 180 degrees hot air for about 45 minutes.
    If necessary, turn the potatoes a few times along the way.
