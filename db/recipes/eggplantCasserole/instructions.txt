Preheat oven to 375Â°. In a saucepan, bring the water to a boil; add eggplant. Boil until tender, 5-8 minutes. Drain and set aside.

STEP 2
In a large skillet, cook beef, onion and green pepper over medium heat until beef is not longer pink, 6-8 minutes, breaking into crumbles; drain. Add tomatoes, salt and pepper. Cook and stir until tomatoes are tender, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in milk, egg and eggplant; mix well.

STEP 3
Transfer to a greased 13x9-in. baking dish. In a small bowl, combine bread crumbs and butter; sprinkle over top. Bake, uncovered, until heated through, 30-35 minutes.
