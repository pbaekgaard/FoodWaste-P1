STEP 1
Combine first 12 ingredients in a 3- or 4-quart slow cooker. Add chicken thighs and stir gently to coat. Cook, covered, on low 3-4 hours or until chicken is tender.

STEP 2
Preheat broiler. Using a slotted spoon, transfer chicken to a broiler-safe baking pan lined with foil. Broil 4-6 inches from heat for 3-4 minutes on each side or until lightly charred.

STEP 3
Meanwhile, transfer cooking juices from slow cooker to saucepan. Cook, uncovered, over medium-high heat until slightly thickened, 6-8 minutes.
Remove from heat and gently stir in yogurt and butter. Serve chicken with sauce. If desired, garnish with chopped cilantro, lemon zest and additional yogurt. Serve with hot cooked rice.
