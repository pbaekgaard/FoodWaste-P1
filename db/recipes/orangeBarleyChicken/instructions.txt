STEP 1
In a large bowl, combine the flour, celery salt and pepper. Add chicken, a few pieces at a time; turn to coat.

STEP 2
In a Dutch oven, brown chicken in oil in batches. Remove and keep warm. 
In the same pan, saute onion in butter until tender. 
Add the broth, orange juice, parsnips, barley, mushrooms, carrots, bay leaves and chicken. 
Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; cover and cook for 45-50 minutes or until barley is tender, turning chicken occasionally.

STEP 3
Transfer chicken to a plate. When chicken is cool enough to handle, remove meat from bones; discard bones. 
Shred meat into bite-sized pieces. Return meat to Dutch oven.

STEP 4
Remove from the heat; let stand for 5 minutes. Discard bay leaves.
