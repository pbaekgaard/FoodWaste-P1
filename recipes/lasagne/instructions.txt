    Lasagna Sauce
  -----------------
    Saute onions and garlic in olive oil until translucent.
    Add the meat and brown it over high heat.
    Turn down the heat and add the rest of the ingredients.
    Let the sauce simmer under the lid for 2-6 hours - the longer, the better.
    Taste the sauce continuously and taste with more spices, tomato puree, peeled tomatoes to taste
    and finally also salt and pepper.
    If you think it gets too dry, you can add more vegetable broth,
    but wait until it has simmered for an hour because the vegetables also add a lot of moisture to the sauce.

    Mornay Sauce
  ----------------
    Melt the butter in a pan, add flour and whisk until it has gathered into a bun.
    Whisk the milk slowly for a little at a time until the consistency is like a sauce.
    Add cheese and whisk until melted.
    Season with grated nutmeg, salt and pepper.

    Lasagne
  -----------
    Put a layer of mornay sauce in a greased ovenproof dish.
    Then alternately add lasagna sauce and plates to the dish and finish with the sauce.
    Top at the end with a layer of mornay sauce and mozzarella, cut into thin slices.
    Put the dish in a preheated oven at 175 degrees hot air.
    Bake the lasagna for approx. 20-25 minutes, until the lasagne plates are tender with a little bite.
