    1. Peel the potatoes and cut them in smaller pieces.
    2. Put the potatoes in a saucepan and cover them with water.
    3. Boil the potatoes until they are tender. This usually takes about 20 minutes. Do not add salt to the water.
    4. While the potatoes are boiling; peel the onions and dice them finely.
    5. On a frying pan; fry the diced bacon until nice and crisp. Add the diced onions and fry until they become soft,
       transparent and a little golden.
    6. When the potatoes are done; pour away the water and let them cool off a bit without the lid.
    7. Pour the boiled potatoes into a large bowl or in a stand mixer and whip them until they become mashed potatoes.
    8. While whipping the potatoes add the milk and butter stepwise.
       Continue whipping until all the milk and butter are mixed with the potatoes. Add salt to taste.
    9. Serve this dish with the mashed potatoes at the bottom and the bacon and onions as topping. Sprinkle with a little
       chopped parsley. You can also serve some pickled beets to Burning Love.
